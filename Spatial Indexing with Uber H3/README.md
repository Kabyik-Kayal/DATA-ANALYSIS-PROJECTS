# Spatial Indexing with Uber H3

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to Uber's H3 spatial indexing system.

## Overview

H3 is a hierarchical geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells. Developed by Uber, it's an open-source library that enables efficient spatial analysis and operations on geographic data.

## Introduction to H3

H3 addresses many challenges in geospatial analysis by providing:
- Hierarchical structure with multiple resolutions
- Uniform hexagonal grid cells (except for 12 pentagons)
- Efficient proximity and neighbor operations
- Compact representation of geographic areas

## Installation

```bash
# Python
pip install h3

# JavaScript
npm install h3-js

# Other languages available through the H3 core library
```

## Basic Concepts

- **H3 Index**: A 64-bit integer that identifies a specific hexagonal cell
- **Resolution**: H3 supports resolutions 0-15, where higher numbers indicate smaller cells
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Each cell at resolution N contains approximately 7 cells at resolution N+1

## Usage Examples

Examples of common H3 operations include:

```python
import h3

# Convert lat/lng to H3 index
lat, lng = 37.7752, -122.4184
h3_index = h3.geo_to_h3(lat, lng, 9)  # Resolution 9

# Get the hexagon boundary
hexagon = h3.h3_to_geo_boundary(h3_index)

# Find neighboring hexagons
neighbors = h3.k_ring(h3_index, 1)
```

## Applications

- Geospatial analysis and clustering
- Efficient spatial joins
- Location-based services
- Geofencing and territory management
- Movement and trajectory analysis
