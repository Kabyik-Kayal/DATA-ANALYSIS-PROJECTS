# Large Scale Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis on Online Retail Data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from a huge dataset efficiently.

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Fireducks
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn
-   Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd large-scale-data-analysis
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib fireducks
    ```

## Data Ingestion

The Data is ingested using Fireducks integrated Pandas that reduced the ingestion time by 2x than normal Pandas ingestion.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

Data cleaning and transformation are performed using Python scripts and Pandas. 

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is performed using Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks contain code for exploring the data, performing statistical analysis.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is used to communicate the results of the data analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create charts and graphs.
